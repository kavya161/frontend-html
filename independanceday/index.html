The ratio of width of the flag to its length is two to three. In the centre of the white band is a navy-blue wheel with 24 equally spaced spokes which represents the Ashoka Chakra.

The design of the National Flag was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on 22 July 1947.The flag should be rectangular in shape.

The flag should not be doubled as a part of costume or uniform. It should not be embedded on any dress material.
The flag should not be lowered to salute any person.
Any kind of lettering should not be put on the flag.
It should not be deliberately displayed with ‘saffron’ down.
A flag, if damaged or dishevelled, should not be used.

It should be flown on important public buildings only such as High Courts, Commissioners’ Offices, Secretariats, Collectorates, Municipalities and Zilla Parishads, Jails and offices of the District Boards, and Departmental/Public Sector Undertakings.

By India Today Web Desk: Every year Independence Day is celebrated on August 15. The celebration of independence occurred in 1947 when India got freedom from British rule. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hoist the national flag at the Red Fort to address the entire country.
India’s independence went through the phase of a struggle-truce-struggle that led to India being free from the dominance of colonial rule. Independence was achieved at the cost of many brave lives of our freedom fighters. This results in observing the day across the country.
